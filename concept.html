  <h2>iF Design Award 2013</h2>
<img src="http://in-ei-isseymiyake.com/cms/wp-content/uploads/2013/05/concept1.jpg" width="100%">

<p>Artemide wins the iF Product Design Award 2013 with<span>IN-EI</span> collection, design <span>Issey Miyake, Reality Lab.</span> <br>
  <span>IN-EI ISSEY MIYAKE</span> collection was co-developed and manufactured by Artemide. It is a collection of free-standing, table and hanging lights. 
The structure of the recycled material, together with an additional surface treatment allows these shades to perfectly keep their shape without the need for internal frame, and to be re-shaped when needed. They can be easily stored flat when not in use.<br>
The art of lighting has a conceptual and technological heritage at the Miyake Design Studio, dating back to 2010, when<span> Issey Miyake </span>and his research and development team called Reality Lab., 
presented <span>132 5. ISSEY MIYAKE.</span><br>
This new process was developed using a mathematical program with 3-D geometric principals by Jun Mitani. The project comes from the intersection of creativity and mathematics, resulting in clothing that can be folded flat and become 3D shapes, starting from a single piece of cloth. <br>
The project revolves around a fabric derived from entirely recycled materials, diffusing light in extremely interesting ways; it is a re-treated fibre made using PET bottles. The bottles are processed using an innovative technology that reduces both energy consumption and CO2 emissions up to 40% when compared to the production of new materials.<br>
Artemide animates these sustainable and striking shapes using LED lighting, today's most relevant sustainable technology.
